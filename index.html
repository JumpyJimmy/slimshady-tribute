      <h3>A Timeline of Eminem's Rap Career:</h3>
      <fieldset>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1972</strong> - Born in St. Joseph, Missouri</li>
        <li><strong>1996</strong> - Eminem and five other rappers formed The Dirty Dozen (D12). Eminem also released his debut album <em>'infinite'</em> which was a commercial failure.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - Eminem released <em>'The Slim Shady LP'</em> in February and would end up being certified triple platinum by the end of that year. </li>
        <li><strong>2000</strong> - <em>'The Marshall Mathers LP'</em> was released and it sold 1.76 million copies in the first week breaking US records for fastest-sellng hip hop album and for fastest-selling solo album. The album was certified Diamond in 2011.</li>
        <li><strong>2002</strong> - <em>'The Eminem Show'</em> was released and it was another success, selling 1.33 million copies in the first week and was the best-selling album of 2002.</li>
        <li><strong>2004</strong> - <em>'Encore'</em> was a success but did not do quite as well as his previous albums as sales were driven partially by the first single 'Just Lose It'.</li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - Eminem was hospitalised after a methadone overdose. After being checked out and some unfortunate events, his drug use "ramped back up to where it was before". After seeking help from a rehabilitation counselor, he has been sober since April 2008.</li>
        <li><strong>2009 - Comeback.</strong> Eminem released <em>'Relapse'</em>, although it did not sell as much as his previous albums, it was a success and re-established his presence in the hip hop world.</li>
        <li><strong>2010</strong> - <em>'Recovery'</em> was released selling over 741,000 copies in the first week and topping the Billboard 200 chart. <em>'Recovery'</em> was the best selling album of 2010 making Eminem the first artist in history to have two year-end best-selling albums. <em>'Recovery'</em> is the best selling digital album in history.</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - <em>'The Marshall Mathers LP 2'</em> was released making Eminem the first American artist with seven consecutive UK number-one albums also securing his position as Canada's best selling artist and 2013's best selling album.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - Eminem released <em>'Revival'</em> topping the US Billboard 200 chart again. However, it had mixed reviews from critics and was considered his worst album.</li>
        <li><strong>2018</strong> - <em>'Kamikaze'</em>, his first surprise album was released in response to the backlash from his previous album. It topped the US Billboard 200 again making it his ninth album in a row to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>2020</strong> - Eminem released another surprise album <em>'Music to Be Murdered By'</em> debuting number one at the Billboard 200 causing him to be the first artist to have ten consecutive debuting at number one in the US. A deluxe album <em>'Music to Be Murdered By - Side B'</em> also was released without any prior notice and debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 later that year.</li>
        <li><strong>2022</strong> - Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</li>
      </ul>
